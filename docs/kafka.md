# Kafka Configuration Report for AdVibe - Real-Time Impression & Click Processing

## Overview
This report provides an in-depth analysis of the optimal configuration for Apache Kafka to meet the performance requirements of the AdVibe application. AdVibe processes a high volume of ad impression and ad click events, necessitating a robust and efficient Kafka setup.

## Requirements
1. **High Throughput**: Support for 1 million requests per second.
2. **Low Latency**: Ensure real-time processing and updates.
3. **Message Order**: Manage potential out-of-order events.
4. **Scalability**: Efficiently handle increasing data volumes.
5. **Fault Tolerance**: Maintain message integrity and availability.

## Configuration Components

### Topic Configuration
Topics are essential for categorizing messages in Kafka.

- **Number of Partitions**
  - **Pros**: More partitions allow parallel processing and higher throughput.
  - **Cons**: Too many partitions can increase overhead and coordination complexity.
  - **Calculation**:
    - Letâ€™s assume each partition can handle 10,000 messages per second.
    - To support 1 million requests per second:
      $$
      \text{Number of Partitions} = \frac{1,000,000}{10,000} = 100
      $$
  - **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    num.partitions: 100
    ```

- **Replication Factor**
  - **Pros**: Higher replication ensures data availability and fault tolerance.
  - **Cons**: Increases storage requirements and write latency.
  - **Decision**: A replication factor of 3 offers a balance between availability and resource use.
  - **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    replication.factor: 3
    ```

### Producer Configuration
Producers send messages to Kafka and their configuration affects throughput and latency.

- **Acks (Acknowledgments)**
  - **Pros**: `acks=all` ensures message durability by waiting for all in-sync replicas to acknowledge.
  - **Cons**: Increases latency.
  - **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    acks: all
    ```

- **Batch Size and Linger.ms**
  - **Pros**: Larger batch sizes and a higher linger time can increase throughput by sending messages in batches.
  - **Cons**: May increase latency.
  - **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    batch.size: 32768  # 32 KB
    linger.ms: 5
    ```

### Consumer Configuration
Consumers read messages from Kafka and their configuration impacts performance.

- **Max Poll Records**
  - **Pros**: Higher max poll records can boost throughput by fetching more messages per poll.
  - **Cons**: Too high may lead to memory issues.
  - **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    max.poll.records: 500
    ```

- **Auto Offset Reset**
  - **Options**:
    - **earliest**: Start from the beginning if no offset is found.
    - **latest**: Start from the latest if no offset is found.
  - **Decision**: Use `earliest` to ensure no events are missed.
  - **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    auto.offset.reset: earliest
    ```

### Handling Out-of-Order Events
Out-of-order events are inevitable in distributed systems. Our approach:

- **Temporary Storage and Reconciliation**: Store click events temporarily if they arrive before impression events. Reconcile once the corresponding impression event arrives.

### Delivery Guarantees
Balancing between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

- **Idempotent Producer**
  - **Pros**: Guarantees exactly-once delivery semantics.
  - **Cons**: Slightly higher complexity.
  - **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    enable.idempotence: true
    ```

- **Message TTL (Time to Live)**
  - **Pros**: Ensures stale messages are discarded.
  - **Cons**: Requires careful tuning.
  - **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    message.ttl.ms: 60000  # 60 seconds
    ```

### Resource Management
Proper resource allocation is key to Kafka's performance.

- **Broker Resources**
  - **Heap Size**: Tune JVM heap size based on broker hardware.
  - **Disk**: Ensure adequate disk space for log retention.

### Monitoring and Metrics
Regular monitoring is essential for adjusting configurations based on performance.

- **Tools**: Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor Kafka.
- **Metrics**: Key metrics include request rate, consumer lag, and resource utilization.

This revised configuration aims to balance the trade-offs between throughput, latency, and fault tolerance, ensuring that AdVibe meets its high-performance requirements. Continuous monitoring and adjustments based on real-world performance are essential for maintaining optimal efficiency.
